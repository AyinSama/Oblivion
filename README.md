# Oblivion

Oblivion is a sample x64 exe packer.
Note: It is not perfect at present. Especially code style and encrypt part. I will refactor it in the future.

## Usage

`Oblivion.exe [file]`

`file` is the path of the file to be protected.

## Build

1. Open `Oblivion.sln`
2. Build Project `Stub`
3. Build Project `Oblivion`
